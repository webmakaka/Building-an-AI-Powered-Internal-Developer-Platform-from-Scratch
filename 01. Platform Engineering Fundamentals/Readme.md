# Session 1 — Platform Engineering Fundamentals

**Day 1 | Session 1 of 4**

## Overview

This session answers the "why" before diving into the "how." You'll assess your current platform maturity, identify developer friction points, and understand the design principles that separate a successful IDP from a pile of tools bolted together. Everything in this session runs with Python 3 alone — no cluster needed yet.

## What You'll Learn

- Why platform engineering exists and the problems it solves
- Platform as Product thinking and Conway's Law
- The maturity model: from ad-hoc scripts to self-service platform
- Design principles from *The Platform Engineer's Handbook*
- How to measure developer experience (DevEx) as a baseline

## Knowledge Prerequisites

- Comfortable using a terminal (cd, ls, running scripts)
- Basic Python 3 (running scripts, reading output — no advanced coding needed)
- General understanding of what a software development lifecycle looks like
- No Kubernetes or cloud experience required — Session 1 is entirely conceptual

## Tools Required

- Python 3.10+

## Contents

| Folder | What's Inside |
|---|---|
| [demo/](demo/) | Platform maturity assessment (interactive) |
| [takehome/](takehome/) | Deep analysis: design principles checklist, DevEx survey, friction analyzer, KPI baseline |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Demo — score your org across self-service, observability, security, and DevEx
$ cd demo
$ python platform-maturity-assessment.py
```

<br/>

```shell
$ cat assessment_results.json
```

<br/>

```shell
# Take-home exercises
$ cd takehome

# Evaluate against the 12 platform design principles (API-first, guardrails, etc.)
$ python design-principles-checklist.py ../demo/platform-config.yaml

# Interactive CLI survey — collects developer feedback, produces a DevEx score (0-100)
$ python devex-survey.py

# Map the onboarding workflow step by step and rank friction points by time impact
$ python friction-analyzer.py --workflow onboarding

# Collect DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate) as your baseline
$ python platform-kpi-collector.py
```

<br/>

## Key Takeaway

You can't improve what you don't measure. The maturity assessment and KPI baseline you establish here become your "before" snapshot — you'll revisit them in Session 9 to prove the platform's value.

## Go Deeper

This session covers Chapters 1-3 of *The Platform Engineer's Handbook*
