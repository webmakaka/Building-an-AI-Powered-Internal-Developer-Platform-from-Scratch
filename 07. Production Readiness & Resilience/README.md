# Session 7 — Production Readiness, Security & Resilience

**Day 2 | Session 3 of 5**

## Overview

Your platform needs to survive failure. This session injects real faults with Chaos Mesh, deploys services with canary and blue-green strategies that roll back automatically on error, sets up Velero for cluster backup/restore, and shows AI-powered runbook automation that converts your existing markdown runbooks into executable scripts with built-in safety gates.

## What You'll Learn

- Chaos engineering with Chaos Mesh (network delay, pod kill, pod failure)
- Progressive delivery: canary + automated rollback controller
- Blue-green deployment patterns
- Backup and disaster recovery with Velero
- AI runbook automation: markdown runbooks to executable steps
- Security scanning in CI pipelines

## Knowledge Prerequisites

- Everything from Sessions 1-6
- Understand deployment strategies at a high level (rolling, canary, blue-green)
- Know what chaos engineering is (intentionally injecting failures to test resilience)
- Basic understanding of backup and disaster recovery concepts
- Familiarity with what runbooks are (step-by-step incident response procedures)

## Tools Required

- kubectl, Helm (Chaos Mesh, Velero), Python 3

## Verify Your Setup

```bash
python3 verify_module.py
```

## Contents

| Folder | What's Inside |
|---|---|
| [demo/](demo/) | Chaos experiments, canary deployment, rollback controller, AI runbook automator |
| [takehome/](takehome/) | Pod kill/failure chaos, blue-green deployment, Velero backup/restore, security scanning, resilience tests |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Demo
cd demo

# Inject 100ms network latency into api-service pods via Chaos Mesh
kubectl apply -f chaos-network-delay.yaml

# Orchestrate the chaos experiment with safety controls and recovery monitoring
python3 chaos-runner.py

# Deploy a canary version alongside stable — traffic split with automated rollback on errors
kubectl apply -f canary-deployment.yaml

# Monitor canary health metrics and auto-rollback if thresholds are breached
python3 rollback-controller.py

# AI-powered: convert a markdown runbook into executable steps with safety gates
python3 runbook-automator.py

# Take-home exercises
cd takehome

# Kill random pods to test self-healing and measure recovery time
kubectl apply -f chaos-experiment-pod-kill.yaml

# Deploy blue-green: two full environments, instant traffic switch with instant rollback
kubectl apply -f blue-green-deployment.yaml

# Schedule automated Velero backups of cluster state
kubectl apply -f velero-schedule.yaml

# Validate SLO definitions, backup configs, and chaos experiment YAML
python3 test-resilience.py
```

## Key Takeaway

Chaos experiments discover how your system breaks before users do. AI runbook automation doesn't replace SREs — it gives them a co-pilot that identifies which steps need human approval vs. auto-execute.

## Go Deeper

This session covers Chapter 12 of [*The Platform Engineer's Handbook*](https://peh-packt.platformetrics.com/), which goes further into production readiness checklists, advanced progressive delivery with Argo Rollouts, and security hardening. See the [book repo](https://github.com/achankra/peh) for the full code samples.
